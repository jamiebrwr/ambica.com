================ INSTALLATION ================

To install this add-on for Easy Content Types, simply upload the "ecpt-filter-by-taxonomy" folder to your wp-content/plugins folder.

Next, navigate to your WordPress plugins menu and click "Activate" on "Easy Content Types: Filter By Taxonomy".

Note, this add-on plugin requires that Easy Content Types be installed and activated, and that it be of version 2.3.5 or later.



================ USAGE =======================

This add-on plugin is extremely simple to use. Once it is activated, there will be a new option added to your Easy Content Type's taxonomy creation / edit screens.

== Enabling the filter option ==

When adding a new taxonomy, there will be an option called "Enable Filter" under the Taxonomy Options. If you check this box, then the filter will be added to all post types that use this taxonomy. So if you have registered this taxonomy with the default Posts and a custom psot type called Books, then the taxonomy filter will be available on the post list for each of these post types. The post list is the page that displays all of the entries in the post type.

The same "Enable Filter" option will be available when editing a custom taxonomy that has been created with Easy Content Types. When editing, the "Enable Filter" option is placed under "Attributes" at the bottom of the screen.

== Using the filter option ==

Once you ahve enabled the filter for a taxonomy, a drop down menu with all of the terms in the taxonomy will be displayed on the post list page for the post type the taxonomy is attached to. To filter the post list by a particular term in the taxonomy, simply click on the menu that says "Show All {taxonomy name}", choose a term, and click filter. This will cause WordPress to only display the items that are filed into that particular term. So if you have enabled the filter for a taxonomy called "genres", then the drop down would read "Show All Genres". Once you have selected a term in the drop down, the selected term will remain highlighed, to indicate the currently active filter.

When viewing the filter drop down, each of the terms in the menu will contain a number in parentheses. This is the number of items that are filed in that particular term. Note, the number shown may not correspond to the number of items in the currently viewed post type, as the count is the number of items in that term from ALL post types.

== Filtering by more than one taxonomy at once ==

If you have more than one taxonomy filter enabled for a post type, then the select menus will be shown side to side. You may filter by more than one taxonomy at a time. So if you have Genres and Topics and you choose "rock" from the genres menu, and you choose "software" from the topics menu, then WordPress will only display the items that are filed into BOTH of the selected terms.

== Removing a filter once added ==

If you decide that you want to disable a filter for a taxonomy, all you need to do is simply uncheck the box from the taxonomy edit page. The filter will be immediately removed and no data will be harmed or altered. The filter may be re-enabled at any time.
